    <p>Enter the overworld coordinates you want to go to, separated by a comma, then press enter.</p>
    <input type="text" onChange="findStop()" id="coords" placeholder="x, y"/>
  <p id="result1"> </p>
  <p id="result2"></p>
  <p>Note: I am going off of screenshots for coords because the server is offline right now. Coords might be like 10-20 blocks off, and Matthew's base is missing. Expect more accuracy once I update them. I am also writing this at 2 AM so it's possible I've catastrophically screwed something up and will realize tomorrow.</p>
